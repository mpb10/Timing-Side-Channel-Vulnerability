These are three PowerShell scripts that demonstrate, in a very basic manner, what timing side-channel vulnerabilities are.

# 

In a very, very basic manner, these three scripts represent a login server that compares a user provided password hash with a stored password hash. If the two hashes match, the user is "authenticated".

# USAGE

To use the scripts, run them via the PowerShell command line and provide two string parameters that are 32 characters in length each (these represent md5 hashes).

Example: `.\VulnerableScript.ps1 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 c48c29157e2b358cc144027f3e2d8cb4`

# EXPLANATION

The `VulnerableScript.ps1` file is vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks because the script exits the hash comparison as soon as it realizes they do not match. An attacker can pay attention to how long it took to compare the hashes in order to tell how close their hash is to the actual one.

The `SecureScript-Option1.ps1` file fixes this vulnerability by always taking a set amount of time to return the results of the comparison to the user, even if the script realizes that the hashes don't match and exits the while-loop early on. The `SecureScript-Option2.ps1` file fixes this vulnerability in a different way by continuing through the while-loop even after the script realizes that the hashes don't match. The goal here is to always return the results after the same, or very close, amount of time.
