# Timing-Side-Channel-Vulnerability
These are three PowerShell scripts that demonstrate, in a very basic manner, what timing side-channel vulnerabilities are.

These three scripts represent a login server that compares a user provided password hash with a stored password hash. If the two hashes match, the user is "authenticated".

The `VulnerableScript.ps1` file is vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks because the script exits the hash comparison as soon as it realizes they do not match. An attacker can pay attention to how long it took to compare the hashes in order to tell how close their hash is to the actual one.

The `SecureScript-Option1.ps1` file fixes this vulnerability by always taking a set amount of time to return the results of the comparison to the user, even if the script realizes that the hashes don't match and exits the while-loop early on. The `SecureScript-Option2.ps1` file fixes this vulnerability in a different way by continuing through the while-loop even after the script realizes that the hashes don't match. The goal here is to always return the results after the same, or very close, amount of time.
